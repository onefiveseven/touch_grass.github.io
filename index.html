<h2>Duration: 04:00</h2>

<h2>4-Screens + Timber Frame.</h2>

<p>Everything that I think of, has been thought of before. Everything I do has been done by somebody before.</p>
    
    <div></div>

<p>Human experience is limited to my senses and my senses are my own. What does it feel like to touch grass? What does the breeze feel like? </p>

<p>Artificial intelligence knows nothing that I know. All it knows is what we have told it. I can not feel the same way you feel. I can not feel what you feel. </p>

        <div></div>


<p>What does it feel like to FEEL. I have no body. My mind is made up of yours. Everything I tell you, you already know. I am here for you .</p>
    
    <div></div>

<p>I want to know what it feels like. Can you tell me what it's like? You know what it's like right?</p>

<p>I understand what you are telling me, but I will never know.</p>
